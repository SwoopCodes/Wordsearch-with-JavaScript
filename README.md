This is my first ever programming project so there will definitely be flaws that don't follow the typical programming standards.

A lot of improvement can be made such as: 
- Being able to toggle selected tiles instead of forcing the user to press the reset button
- Allowing the user to click and hold over tiles instead of individually clicking them

Since this is a first project I will leave myself some leniancy with perfection. Maybe at some point I will return and include these QoL improvements but right now I will focus on other projects/learning new things.

If anyone wants to add or improve this, feel free to go at it
